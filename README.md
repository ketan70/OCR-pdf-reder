# OCR-pdf-reder

OCR PDF Reader is a project that uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology to read and extract text from scanned PDF files, making them editable and searchable. The extracted text can then be saved in a text file or used for other purposes. This project can be helpful in digitizing old paper documents or making PDF files more accessible to visually impaired users.

## Technologies used:

Python | 
Pytesseract (OCR library) | 
OpenCV (image processing library) | 
NumPy (numerical computing library) | 
PDFMiner (PDF parsing library)
